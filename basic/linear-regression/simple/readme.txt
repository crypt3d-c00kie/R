# Student Admission Prediction

This project uses a variety of data sources, including past admission data, test scores, and demographic information.The data is processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms, which are trained to identify patterns and trends in the data. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a student being admitted to a particular college or university. The model is tested on a large dataset of real admission data, and its performance is evaluated using a variety of metrics.

The results of the project have been encouraging, with the model achieving a high level of accuracy in its predictions. This project has the potential to be of great value to students, educators, and admission professionals in the city. It could help students make more informed decisions about where to apply, and it could assist admission officers in making more fair and unbiased decisions.
